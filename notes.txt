take notes of issues I had on RHEL 7.4 (like the libwhatever-devel thing and manually installing wget...), but for future use CentOS 7 instead

all hosts should be involved in the cluster and used when running the web install - minimum 3 because ZooKeeper says so (needs 1, 3, 5 to run in quorum)...

for that to work the hosts file on all three need to have internal ip mapped to internal FQDN (AWS takes care of the rest)

also, make sure that all three hosts can ssh to eachother, even the master to itself (so cat the pub key into authorised_keys on all of them)

no need to add all three hosts everywhere it seems, but internal IP and own internal FQDN needs adding on all three

all hosts datanodes, as well as nodemanager

when setting passwords in services, ok to use the same, but make sure it's a strong one and at least 12 characters

look at PyCharm (JetBrains) as Python IDE

As a fun thing, look at thiss AWS script and automate the setup of the cluster for basic Ambari install...
